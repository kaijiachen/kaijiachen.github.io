# When Tires Slip on Purpose: Drift-Based Control for Vehicle Safety

As robotic systems are increasingly deployed in fast, safety-critical settings, reliance on conservative control alone becomes a fundamental limitation. In autonomous driving, many existing approaches restrict vehicle behavior to simplified, easily stabilized regimes. Although effective in nominal operation, this conservatism reduces a vehicle’s ability to react rapidly in rare but critical scenarios, such as abrupt obstacle avoidance on the highway.

My research addresses these challenges by developing **learning-enabled nonlinear MPC frameworks** that combine data-driven modeling with online optimization, enabling robotic vehicles to operate aggressively while maintaining safety and robustness in the presence of model mismatch and uncertainty. 

My current work at [CARA LAB](https://cara-lab-rice.github.io/) focuses on automated vehicle control beyond stability limits, with results coming soon!

# Undergraduate research

My undergraduate research has focused on the **design of mechatronic systems and the rapid prototyping** of robotic and medical devices, with an emphasis on translating engineering concepts into functional, experimentally validated hardware. Through these projects, I have worked at the intersection of mechanical design, modeling, and applied engineering for biomedical and robotic applications.

Representative projects include:

1) [Minimally invasive healing of bone implant-cement interfaces by aerogel cement and remote heating](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100680)

2) [Predicting biaxial failure strengths of aortic tissues using a dispersed fiber failure model](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eml.2024.102287)

3) Senior Design - [An Implantable Finger Prosthetic](https://kaijiasresearch.godaddysites.com/finger-prosthetic)
