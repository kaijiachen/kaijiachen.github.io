# Reliable control of complex systems

With the rapid advancement of robotics and artificial intelligence, robots are now capable of performing tasks that were previously unimaginable. As robotic systems increasingly permeate everyday life, the question of how to control them safely and reliably has not always kept pace with their growing complexity and autonomy. Entering my Ph.D. studies, I aim to bridge this gap by developing principled control frameworks for fast, complex robotic systems that integrate machine learning to handle uncertainty while preserving formal safety and stability guarantees.

I am currently working on automated vehicle control beyond stability limits, with results coming soon!
